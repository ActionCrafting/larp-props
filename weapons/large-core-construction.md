
# The solid core

> This is the only obviously-dangerous part of the prop, so most precautions occur here.

Our stock material is a 14mm fibreglass tube. It has a thin plastic coating, so the diameter is closer to 13mm if this is peeled back. The wall thickness is about 2.5mm.

Our objective in preparing the solid core is twofold:
1. In case of the event where the core escapes the weapon, mitigate the danger of its hard ends, by wrapping them in softer materials.
2. Reduce the chances of the core abrading or piercing its way out of the weapon in the first place, by placing abrasion-resistant and tear-resistant layers along its path.

### Layer 1: Hard plastic
An initial hard layer is added to act as an immediate abrasion barrier and "cap" to contain the cut ends of the fibreglass material.

The stock material that I have comes with hard plastic end-caps from the factory, which are useful for us to keep here:

### Layer 1 alternative: DIY Hard plastic
Without a pre-made hard plastic stopper, we can craft one with a "3D printer pen" and a sanding device:

![](./images/6.jpg "A 3D printer pen")

An initial application of plastic will be quite messy, but by alternating between applying plastic, compressing it (with a heat-proof glove) and sanding the result to expose any flaws, we can produce a solid block to contain the end of the fibreglass:

### Layer 2: Fibreglass tape
The next line of defence is fibreglass reinforced tape, which is highly resistant to tearing. We build up several layers of tape along three different axes to secure the end of the core. A very small amount of superglue (CA) or epoxy is used on the edges of the tape to mitigate future peeling.

### Layer 3: Fabric

In the unlikely case that the previous layers wear through, an abrasion resistant fabric layer is added. Ideally Kevlar is used here, but in these photographs, upcycled denim is used as a more readily available alternative (*note that denim sourced in this way will vary* greatly *in quality and properties, so samples should be tested for abrasion resistance before use*). Glues should be avoided here as they may change the properties of the fabric unpredictable, such as making it brittle and prone to cracking.

The fabric is secured in place with another 3+ layers of fibreglass tape.

> ⚠ If glue is used to mitigate tape peeling as before, only flexible glue (*such as for shoe repairs*) is used *on the outermost layer of tape only* to reduce the likelihood that the fabric is affected.

### Layer 4: Dense, soft plastic
The above layers alone are probably enough to prevent the core from ever wearing through the prop, but a "chair leg protector" is added as a last line of defence. These are usually a flexible but hard-wearing plastic designed to resist a lot of abrasion. This final layer can be held in place with a flexible glue, such as "shoe" glues, or "wet cured" contact cement.

### Final result

The two cores depicted above have been fed to the belt sander so we can view the final cross-section:

# The dense foam core

The hard fibreglass core is now embedded into a dense foam core.

> ⚠ A minimum of approximately 1cm of dense foam should surround all parts of the fibreglass core.

A design is traced onto dense EVA foam layers of 12mm thickness. As the foam layers are thinner than the fibreglass rod, space for the rod is cut from the central layer and also a few millimetres are removed from the adjoining layers. **All** surfaces to be glued should be lightly sanded to promote good adhesion.

As this is just a demonstration, no specific weapon pattern is drawn onto the layers. The layers should be cut slightly larger than the design to allow them to be reduced to size *after* gluing.

Note the left side appears as sanded, right as stock.

### The glue up

Contact cement is used to adhere these foam layers to each other and to the fibreglass core.

It is important to only use a very thin layer on the foam surfaces in order to retain their flexibility. More can be used on hard surfaces and the excess will "wet cure" in any gaps over the next 24 hours.

![](./images/17.jpg "After applying contact adhesive")

Care must be taken when bonding the surfaces together after the glue has "set up". Once two surfaces contact they will immediately bond in place.

> ⚠ If mistakes are made here, it may be required to re-make the dense foam sections...

![](./images/18.jpg "After pressing the surfaces together")

After pressing the surfaces together, a rolling pin is used along each axis to ensure a good bond and that all air pockets are closed. The prop is then placed into a jig underneath enough weight to ensure the surfaces remain in good contact while the glue cures.

![](./images/19.jpg "Weighted to cure")

The next day, hopefully we are met with a solid foam core. In this example, one layer has been left off to act as a cross-section demonstrator.

### Shaping

The prop is now reduced to approximate size and shape using a belt sander, power-file, etc, making sure to leave enough material surrounding the solid core.

![](./images/21.jpg "After initial shaping")

# The striking edges

> Constructing an entire weapon from dense EVA foam is possible if your opponents are OK with a very firm hit... but softer is better.
> 
> Also, if too much contact cement has been used, it can result in inconsistent flexibility between layers (tough zones), giving another reason to specially prepare surfaces meant for striking.

To provide a safer striking surface, the dense foam layers are now shaped approximately one inch (2.5 cm) smaller than the final design. A sample of low density foam slightly larger than required is prepared to replace the striking edge.

> ⚠ **Note:** *In these images a safety rule has been violated -- far less than 1cm of dense foam is left remaining at the tip of the core. This is not to be done in actual props!*

![](./images/22.jpg "Shaped below final size")

As before, both parts are coated in a thin layer of contact cement, and pressed together once the glue is ready. As these parts are likely to be curved now instead of flat layers, a more complex curing jig is required.

![](./images/23.jpg "Contact cement applied to dense and soft parts")

The next day, the final shaping can be performed. When done, a final 1mm thick skin of dense EVA foam is prepared to protect the soft foam and form an even outer layer.

![](./images/25.jpg "Final shaped prop with soft foam, ready to be skinned")

The skin is attached with contact cement as before. As the glue is very tacky, as the outer skin is carefully applied, it can be slightly stretched and warped easily here to adhere to all surfaces without wrinkles. A slightly complex curing jig is required to keep continuous pressure during curing.

![](./images/26.jpg "The skin applied, before curing")

After curing, the skin can be trimmed and any gaps filled with air-drying foam clay or silicone sealant. The skin should be designed to place any gaps or joins in the skin away from striking surfaces.
